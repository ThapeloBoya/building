    <h2>Cost of Weaknesses</h2>
    <p class="about-paragraph">Weaknesses in the construction and building sector can have serious consequences, including lives lost due to building collapses and unsafe structures, significant financial losses from insurance claims, disputes, and failed developments, as well as delays caused by slow approvals and inefficient compliance systems. These issues ultimately reduce investor confidence in the sector, hindering growth and sustainability.</p>
